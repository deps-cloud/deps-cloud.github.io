# Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

To help protect the project owners and contributors to the project, we've established a common set of CLAs.
The Individual Contributor Agreement should be signed by anyone submitting code to the project.
The Corporate Contributor Agreement should be signed by any organization who's engineers are submitting code on their behalf.

### Individual Contributors

For the individual contributor agreement, we leverage [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io).
A copy of this agreement can be found in [individual.md](individual.md).
This agreement will need to be signed by anyone looking to contribute code to the project.  
To sign this agreement, you can go here and sign using your github account:

https://cla-assistant.io/depscloud/deps.cloud

### Corporate Contributors

For the corporate contributor agreement, please complete the [corporate.md](corporate.md) and email it to us at [clas@deps.cloud](mailto:clas@deps.cloud).
This agreement will need to be completed once by a company.
