A little over due, but this release is a first great step towards `v1beta`.
The server-side of our ecosystem now supports the `name` concept.
While our CLI can't quite support it, we're expecting it to be ready in the next release.

In addition to our first major stepping stone towards `v1beta`, we've solidified some of our monitoring.
With all our processes emitting some information, we were able to assemble some preliminary dashboards.
These are available in our deploy repository and can be download there.
