In the last couple of weeks, we finally released support for `v0.3.x`.
In this release, we made some major changes to the deps.cloud ecosystem.

If you're coming `v0.2.x`, the major change to be aware of is the migration from `v1alpha` to `v1beta`.
In changing the API from `v1alpha` to `v1beta`, we introduced a new database table for the v1beta model.
The information from v1alpha endpoints will be available until `v0.4.x` when they'll be released.
You can learn more about this migration in the [v0.3.0 release notes][].

Another big change in `v0.3.x` was a change in supported architectures.
In this minor release, we removed support fot 32-bit architectures.
In addition to dropping 32-bit architecture support, we added support for Apple silicon machines.
This required upgrading our ecosystem to using Go 1.16 which is still early in its release cycle.
If you notice anything odd with our system, please do not hesitate to reach out.

### Notable Updates

* Support for tracking Helm dependencies via `Chart.yaml`
* Support for tracking Python dependencies via `Pipfile` and `requirements.txt`
* `v1beta` endpoints and improved data model
* Apple Silicon support for `deps` CLI
