In this release, we've started to set the project up for general availability.
All of our servers (`gateway`, `tracker`, and `extractor`) now provide both HTTP and gRPC servers.
By default, they are bound to ports `8080` and `8090` respectively. 
Each server now accepts a `--http-port` and `--grpc-port` option to configure the ports.
This also means that we're deprecating the `--port` flag in favor of the others.

With the addition of an HTTP server to each project, we now offer endpoints for troubleshooting each system.
`/healthz` provides access to the current health of the system.
We generate this report using [go-gracefully], a health check library developed to simplify system status.
`/metrics` exposes a standard [Prometheus] metrics endpoint.
This will allow us to hook in service monitors and continue to bolster our ecosystem.

For a full list of updates, take a look at our [release notes].
