## Process and Project Management

The deps.cloud project leverages a public [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/depscloud/projects/1) for tracking its work items.
For new comers, there's a section that provides some detail around how to get started developing on the project.
If you want to submit an issue, you can open one up under the [deps.cloud](https://github.com/depscloud/deps.cloud/issues/new) project.
A triager will take care of moving it to the right project.

## Contributor Agreements

To help protect the project owners and contributors to the project, we've established a common set of CLAs.
The Individual Contributor Agreement should be signed by anyone who submits code to the project.
The Corporate Contributor Agreement should be signed by any organization whose engineers are submitting code on their behalf.

### Individual Contributors

This agreement will need to be signed by anyone looking to contribute code to the project.
