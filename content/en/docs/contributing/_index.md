# Process and Project Management

The deps.cloud project leverages a public [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/depscloud/projects/1) for tracking its work items.
For new comers, there's a section that provides some detail around how to get started developing on the project.

# Contributor Agreements

To help protect the project owners and contributors to the project, we've established a common set of CLAs.
The Individual Contributor Agreement should be signed by anyone who submits code to the project.
The Corporate Contributor Agreement should be signed by any organization whose engineers are submitting code on their behalf.

### Individual Contributors

For the individual contributor agreement, we leverage [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io/depscloud/deps.cloud).
A copy of this agreement can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depscloud/deps.cloud/main/clas/corporate.md).
This agreement will need to be signed by anyone looking to contribute code to the project.
To sign this agreement, you can go here and sign using your github account:
