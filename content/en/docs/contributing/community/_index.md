There are a few different mechanisms that you can use to get ahold of the team.

* [FindCollabs](https://findcollabs.com/project/deps-cloud-GIOlcUiHE9XD2UVlxrNl) is by and large used for status updates and is checked regularly.
* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/depscloud/community) is used for more back and forth communication and will yield faster response times.

Based on conversations with the team, we decided to leverage Gitter as the primary form of communication.

The [community](https://groups.google.com/a/deps.cloud/forum/#!forum/community/join) meeting is a great way to get face to face time with the members of the team.
It can also be a great way to get introduced to the project and where to get started.
The community meeting is held every two weeks (starting 2019/12/30).
By joining the community Google group, you will automatically receive a calendar event for the meeting.
